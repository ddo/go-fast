# go-fast

This is the modified version of [ddo/go-fast](https://github.com/ddo/go-fast), used specifically in my unsucessful attempt at creating a location aware [speed tester](https://github.com/timolinn/spestr)

This version is basically this unmerged [pull request](https://github.com/ddo/go-fast/pull/2#issue-310721373)
